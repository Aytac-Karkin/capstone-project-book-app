# Shelfie

Shelfie is a user-friendly book-tracking app that assists individuals in managing their reading habits. This app is not just a tracker – it's a comprehensive reading assistant, designed to cater to the diverse needs of avid readers, book clubs, and casual readers alike.

## Project

With Shelfie you can track the books you've already read, that you are currently reading and books you would like to read in the future. With the app you can track your reading progress, search for books manually and set reading goals.
